# Conclusion and Future Work

To sum up, our project builds a persistent Memory (which is the cloud drive),**  **a knowledge base for storing messages for finetuning, a message queue for multi-person collaboration, the architecture can extend to way more scenarios.

For instance,**  **if you want a chat-bot to assist you in your work group, like summarizing hundreds of messages you've sent during a heated discussion, or telling you the latest deadline, saving your effort of scrolling through all the group files,

then the memory saves all the messages, and send to the message queue a summary request, which sends request to OpenAI and get the summary answer.
